		<h1>Tales from my European Summer Abroad</h1>
		
		<img src="IMG_9678.JPG" alt="Panoramic Countryside of 
		Salzburg, Austria">
		</div>
		
		<p>
			This past summer I studied abroad in Valencia, Spain.  
			It was a very enjoyable experience and I got to immerse 
			myself in both a language and culture that I love.  At 
			times during my study abroad and for a month and a half 
			afterwards I would take trips to other places and 
			countries.  Below you will find some of my favourite 
			places that I visited and memories I created during my 
			travels.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I have also included my 
			<a HREF="travel_schedule_summer_2016.html">
			Travel Schedule</a> from this past summer in case you 
			are curious.

		<h2>Pompeii/Salerno</h2>
		
		<img src="IMG_9302.JPG" alt="Ancient Amphitheatre in 
		Pompeii">
		</div>
		
		<p>
			My sister Meredith met up with my friend Lauren and me 
			for our Roman leg of the European tour.  We spent most 
			of our six days together in Rome, but decided to take 
			a one day trip to Pompeii to check out all the ruins.  
			We had to take a train to Salerno and from there we 
			caught a bus to reach our destination – the small town 
			of Pompeii.
		</p>

		<div style="text-align:center">

		Food Counter in Pompeii">
		</div>
		
		<p>
			When we got there we spent a few hours doing an audio 
			tour of the ruins and then headed to dinner.  However, 
			we lost track of time at dinner and ended up having to 
			run back to the bus stop to make our bus.  Unfortunately, 
			we ended up standing on the wrong side of the street and 
			an Italian woman convinced us that we were waiting for 
			the same bus as her.  Perhaps the fact that we were only 
			able to communicate with her by using the similarities 
			between Spanish and Italian should have made us double 
			check her advice (or what we <i>thought</i> was the 
			advice she was giving), but that was not the case.  
			Thus, we ended up watching our nonstop charter bus drive 
			by and getting on a city bus to Salerno instead.  
			Shortly after boarding the bus we realised that we would 
			arrive that the train station a full half hour after the 
			last train back to Rome had left the station.  Luckily, 
			a nice university student from Salerno overheard us and 
			ended up helping us book our train tickets for the 
			following day and finding us a hostel to stay in that 
			night.

		<p>
			When we arrived at our hostel we had no clothes or 
			luggage with us whatsoever aside from our wallets and 
			phones, we were disgusting from having spent all day in 
			the heat exploring dirty ruins and we were extremely 
			tired.  My sister Meredith and I ended up finding some 
			laundry detergent in the community bathroom so we used 
			that as soap to take crude showers just to get a 
			<i>little bit</i> cleaner.
		</p>

		<p>
			As if all that wasn't bad enough, by the time 
			we finally got to bed we only had four hours to sleep 
			before we had to wake up to catch our train back to 
			Rome.  While this was one of the <i>worst</i> travel 
			errors I have ever made, I think it may be the funniest 
			story I've ever gotten from my travels.

		<h2>Munich</h2>
		
		<img src="IMG_9675.JPG" alt="Castle in Munich">
		</div>
		
		<p>
			Munich was a great city to visit because it was very 
			clean and very quaint.  I don’t speak a word of German, 
			so I really appreciated that nearly everyone I ran into 
			in Germany spoke English in addition to German.
		</p>
		
		<div style="text-align:center">

		</div>
		
		<p>
			While in Munich my friends Lauren, Shawn, Jesse and I 
			took a walking tour of the city, ate at several beer 
			gardens, visited Dachau concentration camp and enjoyed 
			the city’s extensive park, among other things.  My 
			favourite memory from my time in Munich must have been 
			my discovery of a new, edgy sport – river surfing.

		<div style="text-align:center">

		German-Greek Festival in Munich">
		</div>
		
		<p>
			There is a fast-moving river that runs right through the 
			centre of Munich’s scenic park and many people have used 
			this river to practice hanging ten on some white-water 
			rapids.  Who’d have guessed landlocked Munich of all 
			places would have <i>so many</i> surfer dudes!
